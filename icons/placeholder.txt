Create the following icon files for the extension:

1. icon16.png - 16x16 pixels
2. icon48.png - 48x48 pixels
3. icon128.png - 128x128 pixels

You can create a simple icon with "KT" (for Kokborok Translator) or a logo representing translation.

For temporary testing, you can use any standard icons, but for production, create custom icons that represent your extension's purpose.

Once you've created the icons, this placeholder file can be deleted.
